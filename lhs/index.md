Here are some guides (and other useful things) for Linux. Let me know if you
want to contribute to them.

Download this entire guide and all the media associated with it:

```bash
$ git clone --branch ehildenb 'git://gitnet.net/work/lhs/'

# Update the guide (from inside the guide directory)

```

Topics we have guides on:

-   [Linux shells (terminal)](shell/)
-   [Python programming language](python/)

-   [Linux program configurations (dotfiles)](dotfiles/)
