title: Linux Shells
...

These excercises are setup to help you learn about the Linux shell. Try to stay
in your terminal the whole time you're working - the key to getting used to the
shell is practice.

You can open the [cheatsheet](cheatsheet.html) to help you remember commands.


Excercise 1
===========

In this excercise we'll practice extracting data from a file. The files you'll
need are in the [exercise_1](exercise_1/) directory. This will help when trying
to extract data from large or complicated files.


Excercise 2
===========

Now we'll work on parameter sweeps and automation. The files you'll need are in
the [exercise_2](exercise_2/) directory.
