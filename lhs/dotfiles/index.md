Dotfiles
========

Dotfiles (named that way because of the '.' at the beginning of many of their
name) are the configuration files for your system. They tell the programs on
your system how to behave, and are used on all sorts of devices, from laptops
to servers to embedded systems.

These are some sample dotfiles we've put together. They are 'loosely'
maintained, and should be taken as starting points for you to use. They should
all be fully functional as is with minor modifications (filling in your
personal information, etc...).

To browse the dotfiles we have available, see them clone this repo:

```bash
% git clone 'git://gitnet.net/work/lhs'
```

The files in the directory 'lhs/dotfiles'.
